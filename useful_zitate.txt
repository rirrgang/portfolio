"Don't run through your life so fast that
you forget not only where you've been
but also where you're going.

Knowledge is weightless, a treasure you can
always carry easily.

Life is not a race but a journey to be
savored each step of the way.

Yesterday is history tomorrow is a mystery
and today is a gift - that's why they call
it the present"

- Brian Dyson (ex. CEO of Coca Cola)
